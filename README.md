# microbit-fidgetbit
The A and B buttons each create an LED wave toward the button direction.

When the A+B buttons are pressed, the wave is generated upward and disappears when released.

Touching the logo prints the micro:bit logo. It's cute.

Shaking it turns the LEDs on and off at random X,Y values.

When you shake it, it looks like the lights are rolling because of the afterimage.
